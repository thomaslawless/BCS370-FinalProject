I'm thinking we implement a main menu type of system like so

########################################
#     WELCOME TO HOMEWORK TRACKER      #
#  1. CHECK GRADES                     #
#  2. LIST ASSIGNMENTS AND DUE DATES   #
#  3. VIEW COMPLETED ASSIGNMENTS       #
#  4. QUIT                             #
########################################

Then just run an if statement or case to run the function based on number selected

Checking grades will list completed assignments with the grade given

Maybe 3 is redundant then... 

let me know what you think.
